    "## Problem 1 (Portfolio Wealth Growth)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Portfolio Wealth Growth Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "This section delves into the theoretical mathematical foundation governing the growth of portfolio wealth over time. The analysis is crucial for understanding how investments evolve under the influence of various market factors, including returns and volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.1 Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The wealth process $\\{V_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ is modeled as a geometric Brownian motion (GBM), which is frequently used to represent stock prices and, by extension, portfolio values under stochastic environments. The stochastic differential equation (SDE) governing this process is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{d V_t}{V_t} = \\mu dt + \\sigma dW_t \\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Portfolio Wealth Growth Simulation vs. Expectation\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- $V_t$ represents the portfolio value at time $t$.\n",
    "- $\\mu$ is the expected return of the portfolio, expressed as a percentage of the portfolio value.\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ is the volatility of the portfolio, which measures the standard deviation of the portfolio's returns.\n",
    "- $dW_t$ is the increment of a standard Brownian motion, which captures the random fluctuations in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation (1) can be interpreted as follows:\n",
    "- The term $\\mu dt$ captures the expected growth of the portfolio due to returns over an infinitesimally small time interval $dt$.\n",
    "- The term $\\sigma dW_t$ introduces randomness into the growth process, reflecting the uncertainty and risk inherent in the financial markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Solution to the Differential Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to the stochastic differential equation (SDE) given in equation (1) can be expressed explicitly by integrating both sides over the interval from $0$ to $t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ln \\frac{V_t}{V_0} = \\left(\\mu - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\right)t + \\sigma W_t \\tag{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $V_0$ is the initial value of the portfolio at time $t=0$.\n",
    "- $W_t$ represents the standard Brownian motion at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "From equation (2), we can exponentiate both sides to obtain the explicit form of $V_t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_t = V_0 \\exp{\\left( (\\mu - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2})t + \\sigma W_t \\right)} \\tag{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Mathematical Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation (3) clearly shows how the portfolio value $V_t$ evolves over time. It indicates that the portfolio value is log-normally distributed with its mean and variance increasing over time. This formulation is fundamental in finance for modeling asset prices and helps in understanding the dynamic nature of investment growth under uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.2 Expectation of Portfolio Wealth\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section explores and delves into the expectation (first raw moment/arithmetic average) of the portfolio wealth process.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Expectation Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the wealth process $V_t$ which follows a geometric Brownian motion (GBM) as described by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{dV_t}{V_t} = \\mu dt + \\sigma dW_t \\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this stochastic differential equation (SDE) indicates:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_t = V_0 \\exp{\\left( (\\mu - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2})t + \\sigma W_t \\right)} \\tag{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the expectation $\\mathbb{E}[V_t]$, we note that $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion (BM), which implies $\\sigma W_t$ is normally distributed with mean $0$ and variance $\\sigma^2 t$. Thus, $\\sigma W_t \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 t)$, and $e^{\\sigma W_t}$ follows a log-normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the moment-generating function (MGF) of a normally distributed random variable to compute the expectation of a log-normal variable. For a random variable $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_X, \\sigma_X^2)$, the MGF of $X$ at $s$ is $M_X(s) = e^{\\mu_X s + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma_X^2 s^2}$. Setting $s = 1$, we find:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[e^X] = e^{\\mu_X + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma_X^2} \\tag{4}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying this to our case, where $\\mu_X = 0$ and $\\sigma_X^2 = \\sigma^2 t$, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[e^{\\sigma W_t}] = e^{0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 t} = e^{\\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 t} \\tag{5}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, substituting this into the solution for $V_t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[V_t] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[V_0 \\exp\\left((\\mu - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}) t + \\sigma W_t\\right)\\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "= V_0 \\exp \\left( (\\mu - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}) t \\right) \\mathbb{E}[e^{\\sigma W_t}] \\tag{6}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting the expectation of $e^{\\sigma W_t}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[V_t] = V_0 \\exp \\left( (\\mu - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2})t \\right) \\exp \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 t \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "= V_0 \\exp (\\mu t) \\tag{7}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the expected wealth at time \\(t\\) is indeed given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[V_t] = V_0 \\exp(\\mu t) \\tag{7}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates that the expectation grows exponentially at a rate determined by the drift $\\mu$, independent of the volatility $\\sigma$.\n",

    "### 1.2 Portfolio Wealth Growth Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section implements applications of factors governing the growth of portfolio wealth over time in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.1 True vs. Expected Path Simulation\n",

    "<figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Table 2 - Comparison of Empirical and Theoretical Probabilities of Terminal Wealth Underperformance</i></figcaption>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table above, we can observe how closely the empirical probabilities and their confidence intervals align with the theoretical probabilities. This comparison helps validate our simulation methodology and provides insight into the accuracy and reliability of our model in capturing the dynamics of terminal wealth underperformance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.3 Probability of Underperformance Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "This section explores the theoretical convergence of the probability $\\mathbb{P}(V_T \\leq \\alpha \\mathbb{E}[V_T])$ as the time horizon $T$ approaches infinity. Understanding this convergence provides insights into the long-term risk profile of the investment strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Theoretical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the stochastic model for terminal wealth:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_T = V_0 \\exp \\left((\\mu - \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2) T + \\sigma W_T\\right) \\tag{8}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $W_T$ is a standard Brownian motion, the variable $V_T$ is log-normally distributed. The expected value of $V_T$ is $V_0 \\exp(\\mu T)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Convergence Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "As $T$ increases, the term $\\sigma W_T$—which has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of $\\sigma \\sqrt{T}$—becomes dominant in influencing the distribution of $\\ln V_T$. This leads us to consider the behavior of the ratio $\\frac{V_T}{\\mathbb{E}[V_T]}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{V_T}{\\mathbb{E}[V_T]} = \\exp \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 T + \\sigma W_T \\right) \\tag{17}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As $T \\to \\infty$, the distribution of $\\ln \\left(\\frac{V_T}{\\mathbb{E}[V_T]}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 T + \\sigma W_T$ shifts towards $-\\infty$, because the deterministic component $-\\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 T$ dominates. Thus, regardless of the value of $\\alpha$ (as long as $\\alpha > 0$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\frac{V_T}{\\mathbb{E}[V_T]} \\leq \\alpha \\right) = \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{P}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 T + \\sigma W_T \\leq \\ln(\\alpha) \\right) = 1 \\tag{18}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that the probability that $V_T$ underperforms $\\alpha \\times \\mathbb{E}[V_T]$ approaches 1 as $T$ becomes very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "This result has significant implications for long-term investment strategies. It suggests that, under the assumed model, the relative underperformance compared to the growing expectation becomes almost certain in the long run. This highlights the importance of considering the effects of volatility and the time horizon in financial planning and risk assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.4 Comparative Analysis of Terminal Wealth Expectation and Long-Run Wealth Trajectories\n",
    "\n",
    "This section delves into the discrepancies between the expected terminal wealth, denoted as $\\mathbb{E}[V_T]$, and the long-run behavior of individual wealth trajectories $V_T$. Understanding these differences is crucial for grasping the risks and variability inherent in investment strategies that follow a geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Overview of Expected Terminal Wealth\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected terminal wealth $\\mathbb{E}[V_T]$ for a portfolio governed by geometric Brownian motion is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[V_T] = V_0 \\exp (\\mu T) \\tag{11}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $V_0$ is the initial investment,\n",
    "- $\\mu$ is the drift coefficient, and\n",
    "- $T$ is the time horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula indicates exponential growth of the expected wealth, driven primarily by the drift $\\mu$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Behavior of Individual Wealth Trajectories\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, individual wealth trajectories $V_T$ are influenced not only by the drift but also significantly by the volatility component $\\sigma$, modeled as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_T = V_0 \\exp \\left((\\mu - \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2) T + \\sigma W_T\\right) \\tag{8}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $W_T$ represents the stochastic term, a standard Brownian motion, which introduces variability and risk into the trajectory. This results in a log-normally distributed terminal wealth, where the actual outcomes can vary widely around the expected value.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Comparative Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "While $\\mathbb{E}[V_T]$ suggests a smooth, ever-increasing path, the reality of individual trajectories $V_T$ can be starkly different. The log-normal distribution implies that while some investment outcomes significantly exceed the expectation, others might fall well below, especially as the time horizon $T$ increases and the effects of volatility accumulate. This variability becomes more pronounced due to the exponential impact of $\\sigma W_T$ in the formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the implication of high volatility $\\sigma$ values: even with a positive drift $\\mu$, the spread of outcomes becomes broader over time, leading to a higher probability of both significantly high and significantly low outcomes relative to the expected value.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Implications for Investors\n",
    "\n",
    "For investors, this analysis underscores the importance of considering volatility and time horizon in their risk assessment. While the average expected outcome might appear attractive, the actual risk of experiencing lower-than-expected returns can be substantial. This emphasizes the need for robust risk management strategies and possibly diversifying to mitigate extreme outcomes."
