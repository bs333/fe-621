    "\n",
    "The price of an **up-and-out put option**/**knock-out** (**UOP**) with strike price $K$ and barrier $H$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P = e^{-r T} \\mathbb{E}^Q[(K - S_T)_+ \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau > T\\}}] \\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tau$ is the *stopping time* of the asset price process $\\{S_t\\}_{t\\geq0}$ to the barrier $H$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tau = \\inf{\\{t > 0 : S_t \\geq H\\}} \\tag{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1.1.2 Indicator Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **indicator function** $\\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau > T\\}}$ in the formula for the up-and-out put option is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau > T\\}} = \n",
    "\\begin{cases} \n",
    "1 & \\text{if } \\tau > T \\\\\n",
    "0 & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases} \\tag{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tau$ is the **stopping time** defined as the first instance when the stock price $S_t$ reaches or exceeds the barrier level $H$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1.1.3 Indicator Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The **infimum function** used to define the stopping time $\\tau$ for the up-and-out put option is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tau = \\inf{\\{t > 0 : S_t \\geq H\\}} \\tag{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this expression:\n",
    "- $\\tau$ represents the **stopping time**, the earliest time at which the stock price $S_t$ reaches or exceeds a predetermined barrier level $H$.\n",
    "- The set $\\{t > 0 : S_t \\geq H\\}$ includes all times $t$ where the stock price is greater than or equal to the barrier $H$.\n",
    "- The function $\\inf{\\{\\cdot\\}}$ denotes the **infimum** of a set, which is the greatest lower bound of that set. In this case, it identifies the *smallest time value* from the set of all times where $S_t$ is at least $H$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the set $\\{t > 0 : S_t \\geq H\\}$ is empty (i.e., the stock price never reaches or exceeds $H$ during the option's life), $\\tau$ is considered infinite, and the indicator function $\\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau > T\\}}$ equals 1, implying that the option behaves like a standard put option throughout its lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1.1.4 Payoff\n",
    "\n",
    "The payoff is the **same** as that of a *vanilla put option*, unless the stock price goes above $H$ during the life of the option, in which case the payoff is **zero**. Assume the process $\\{S_t\\}_{t\\geq0}$ to follow a geometric Brownian motion (GBM)."

    "\n",
    "*a. Is an UOP option cheaper or more expensive than a vanilla put option? Explain.*\n",
    "\n",
    "An **up-and-out put option** (UOP) is generally cheaper than a vanilla put option. This difference in pricing comes from the **additional condition** involved in the UOP, where the option becomes worthless if the stock price exceeds the barrier $H$ before expiration. In a vanilla put option, the holder has the right to sell the stock at the strike price $K$ **regardless of how high the stock price has climbed during the option's life**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This restriction in the UOP **reduces the probability** of a payout compared to a vanilla put option, where there is no upper limit on the stock price affecting the payoff. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the UOP has a **lower premium** due to its *reduced likelihood of exercising profitably*. Essentially, the risk of the option knocking out (i.e., becoming worthless if the stock price exceeds the barrier $H$ reduces its cost.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*(i) What is the definition of $\\hat{P}_{n,m}$ being an unbiased/biased high/biased low estimator for P?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of $\\hat{P}_{n,m}$ being an **unbiased**, **biased high**, or **biased low** estimator for $P$ relates to its **expected value** compared to the true value $P$:\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Biased Low Estimator**: $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{P}_{n,m}] < P$, or the estimator systematically *underestimates* the true price.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This estimator calculates the option price by simulating stock price paths and applying the indicator function to determine if these paths exceed the barrier $H$ before time $T$. The estimator’s potential bias depends significantly on how well the simulation captures the dynamics of the stock price and its interaction with the barrier.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1.2.4 Factors Influencing Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Barrier Breach Underestimation**:\n",
    "   - If the Monte Carlo simulation underestimates the frequency of the barrier breach (due to coarse time grid or insufficient number of paths), the result is an overestimated option price, leading to a **biased high** estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Barrier Breach Overestimation**:\n",
    "   - Conversely, an over-sensitive simulation (possibly due to a very fine time grid) might overestimate barrier breaches, leading to a conservative estimation where the payoff is zeroed out more often than it should be, making the estimator **biased low**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Volatility and Path Dependency**:\n",
    "   - The inherent variability in the GBM model and path dependency can affect the frequency of barrier breaches. Differences in how volatility is modeled and the stochastic nature of the paths can influence whether the simulated paths breach the barrier, thus impacting the bias of the estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1.2.5 Bias Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias of $\\hat{P}_{n,m}$ largely depends on the fidelity of the simulation in representing the true stock price dynamics and its interaction with the barrier $H$. Without precise tuning of simulation parameters and thorough model validation against real-world data, there is a risk that $\\hat{P}_{n,m}$ might be either biased high or biased low. Therefore, careful calibration and extensive validation of the Monte Carlo model are crucial for ensuring the accuracy of the estimator.\n",

    "Basket call options are financial derivatives that derive their value from the performance of a *basket* of underlying assets.

    "##### 2.2.3 Cholesky Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"English\" Definition*\n",
    "\n",
    "Cholesky decomposition is a method in linear algebra for decomposing a Hermitian, positive-definite matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose. This is particularly useful in numerical calculations, such as solving linear equations and simulating correlated random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Mathematical Definition*\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a Hermitian, positive-definite matrix $A$, the Cholesky decomposition expresses $A$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = L L^\\intercal \\tag{9}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $L$ is a lower triangular matrix with real and positive diagonal entries,\n",
    "- $L^T$ is the transpose of $L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Assumptions & Properties*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hermitian**: A matrix $A$ is Hermitian if it is equal to its own conjugate transpose, i.e., $A = A^*$.\n",
    "2. **Positive-Definite**: A matrix $A$ is positive-definite if for all non-zero vectors $x$, the quadratic form $x^\\intercal A x$ results in a positive value, i.e., $x^\\intercal A x > 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.2.3.1 Conjugate Transpose and Positive-Definite Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "*Conjugate Transpose (Hermitian Transpose)*\n",
    "\n",
    "The **conjugate transpose** of a matrix, also known as the Hermitian transpose, is defined for a matrix $A$ with complex entries. For a matrix $A$ of size $m \\times n$ with elements $a_{ij}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A^H_{ji} = \\overline{a_{ij}} \\tag{10}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\overline{a_{ij}}$ is the complex conjugate of $a_{ij}$. This operation results in an $n \\times m$ matrix where each element is the complex conjugate of its transpose element in matrix $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Positive-Definite Matrix*\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix $A$ is **positive-definite** if it meets the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Symmetry**: $A$ must be symmetric (i.e., $A = A^T$) for real matrices or Hermitian (i.e., $A = A^H$) for complex matrices.\n",
    "2. **Positive Quadratic Form**: For all non-zero vectors $x$, the quadratic form must be positive:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x^\\intercal A x > 0 \\tag{11}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This condition must hold for every non-zero vector $x$ in either $\\mathbb{R}^n$ or $\\mathbb{C}^n$, confirming that the matrix does not allow any non-positive outcomes in its quadratic forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.2.4 Cholesky Decomposition (Continued)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Decomposition Process*\n",

    "For $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$ and $j = 1, 2, \\ldots, i$:\n",
    "- **Diagonal Elements**:\n",

    "##### 2.2.4.1 Cholesky Decomposition Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "*Solving Linear Equations*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to solve $Ax = b$, you can decompose $A$ into $LL^\\intercal$, solve $Ly = b$ for $y$ using forward substitution, and then solve $L^\\intercal x = y$ for $x$ using back substitution.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Matrix Inversion*\n",
    "\n",
    "Cholesky decomposition simplifies the inversion of matrices, particularly useful in statistical contexts like covariance matrix inversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Simulation of Correlated Random Variables*\n",
    "\n",
    "By decomposing the covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ into $LL^\\intercal$, it is possible to transform independent standard normal random variables into correlated variables by multiplying them with $L$. This application is crucial in financial modeling for simulating asset prices with specific correlation structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.2.4.2 Cholesky Decomposition Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "Cholesky decomposition is computationally efficient, approximately twice as efficient as LU decomposition for solving systems of linear equations because it only requires half the matrix operations due to its symmetry and positive-definiteness.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is widely used in fields requiring high computational efficiency and accuracy, such as in finance and engineering.\n",
