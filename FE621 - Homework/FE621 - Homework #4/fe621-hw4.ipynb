    "An **up-and-out put option** (UOP) is generally cheaper than a vanilla put option. This difference in pricing comes from the **additional condition** involved in the UOP, where the option becomes worthless if the stock price exceeds the barrier $H$ before expiration. In a vanilla put option, the holder has the right to sell the stock at the strike price $K$ **regardless of how high the stock price has climbed during the option's life**.\n",

    "This restriction in the UOP **reduces the probability** of a payout compared to a vanilla put option, where there is no upper limit on the stock price affecting the payoff. \n",

    "Therefore, the UOP has a **lower premium** due to its *reduced likelihood of exercising profitably*. Essentially, the risk of the option knocking out (i.e., becoming worthless if the stock price exceeds the barrier $H$ reduces its cost."
