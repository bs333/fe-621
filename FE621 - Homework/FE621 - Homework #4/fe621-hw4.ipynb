    "An **up-and-out put option** (UOP) is generally cheaper than a vanilla put option. This difference in pricing comes from the **additional condition** involved in the UOP, where the option becomes worthless if the stock price exceeds the barrier $H$ before expiration. In a vanilla put option, the holder has the right to sell the stock at the strike price $K$ **regardless of how high the stock price has climbed during the option's life**.\n",

    "- **Potential for Bias Low**: KO put may be biased low due to the *discretization* of the path simulation. In practical settings, the simulation might not capture every peak that crosses the barrier $H$ within the continuous monitoring of the actual path, especially if the time steps ($\\Delta t$) are not small enough. This miss means some paths that should knock out (reach or exceed $H$) might not actually do so in the simulation, leading to an *overestimation of paths* that contribute to the payoff sum, hence **underestimating** the true option price where more paths should knock out.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Discretization Error**: As the number of time steps $m$ increases (i.e., the simulation becomes more granular), the estimator should become *less biased*. The limit of the estimator as $(m \\to \\infty)$, with continuous monitoring of the barrier, would theoretically be unbiased. However, for finite $m$ and practical implementations, we might expect a bias due to discretization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random Fluctuations and Estimator Variance**: The *standard deviation* of the estimator can also play a role in perceived bias over different simulations. With a finite number $N$ of paths, random fluctuations might cause $\\hat{P}_{n,m}$ to occasionally estimate higher or lower than its expected value, but that's more generally about variance than systematic bias (which can occur for any simulation with standard errors in Bayesian statistics)."
