    "The Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) binomial tree model is a popular method for pricing European and American options. This model approximates the dynamics of a stock following a geometric Brownian motion (GBM) by discretizing the stock price movements over time into an up or down movement at each step of the tree. The parameters $p, u, d$ are crucial for constructing the binomial tree. They represent the probability of an up move, the up move factor, and the down move factor, respectively. The formulas for these parameters are derived from the characteristics of the geometric Brownian motion, which is described by a drift rate $r$ (risk-free interest rate) and a volatility $\\sigma$. The time to maturity of the option is divided into $n$ equal intervals of length $\\Delta t$.\n",

    "  This probability is used to calculate the expected value of the option at each node in a risk-neutral world, where all investors are indifferent to risk. It reflects the probability of the stock price moving up in the next time step.\n",
