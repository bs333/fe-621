## FE621 - Computational Methods in Finance

This repository hosts all the resources, including codes, assignments, and lecture notes, for the course FE621 - Computational Methods in Finance.

### Course Objective

The aim of this course is to equip students with an understanding of the essential computational tools used by quantitative analysts in the financial industry and to enable them to apply these tools to areas such as forecasting, asset pricing, hedging, risk management, and various other financial applications. It is expected that students have a strong mathematical foundation (as covered in FE543/FE610) and are familiar with derivatives terminology and concepts at the level discussed in Hull's textbook (FE620).

The course covers:
1. A review of financial modeling and numerical analysis including root-finding, numerical integration and differentiation, and error analysis.
2. The development and application of lattice/tree methods in financial modeling.
3. The principles and applications of Monte Carlo simulation in finance.
4. The use of finite difference methods for solving differential equations in financial engineering.
5. Exploration of additional topics as time permits, including calibration and optimization techniques, machine learning applications in finance, asset allocation, risk management, and high-frequency trading (HFT).

### Student Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, students will:
1. Have a comprehensive understanding of computational tools and techniques essential for quantitative analysis in finance.
2. Be able to apply these computational tools to solve problems in forecasting, asset pricing, hedging, and risk management among other areas.
3. Develop skills in using numerical methods such as lattice/tree methods, Monte Carlo simulation, and finite difference methods for financial modeling.
4. Explore the application of advanced topics like machine learning in finance, optimizing strategies for asset allocation, and techniques for effective risk management.
